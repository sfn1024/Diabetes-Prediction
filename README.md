# Diabetes Prediction

Note
* This is a simple Neural Network Project
* You can use Google Colab for model training, the download the trained model and use in the local IDE for testing
* Or you can do the testing in the google colab by pasting and running the code in testing.py in a code block
* Or you can also run the whole code in the local IDE
* #You Should run train code first Then run test (Before running make sure to delete or rename the two models [.h5 and .json])

Requierments
1. IDE (Can use Google Colab/ Jupyter Notebook)
2. Python
3. Libraries (Installing Tensorflow will install other libraries used in this project)
    * Tensorflow
    * Keras, h5py, scipy
    * Numpy
